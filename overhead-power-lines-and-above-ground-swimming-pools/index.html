Except where installed with the clearances specified in Table E42036 the following parts of pools and outdoor spas and hot tubs shall not be placed under existing service-drop conductors overhead service conductor or any other open overhead wiring. New swimming pools and spas must be constructed outside of any easement or right-of-way permit and no portion of the water shall be under the high voltage lines. If your proposed pool location necessitates the relocation of overhead wires Hydro Ottawa will assess the situation. Utility-owned -operated and -maintained communications conductors community antenna system coaxial cables and the supporting messengers shall be permitted at a height of not less than 10 feet 3048 mm above swimming and wading pools diving structures and observation stands towers and platforms.
