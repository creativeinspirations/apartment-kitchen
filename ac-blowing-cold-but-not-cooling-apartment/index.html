<p>Your circuit breaker is tripped. My apartment came with a 10000 btu air conditioner but recently since its been in the 90s outside I have been unable to get the thermostat down under 85. Our first recommendation is to check the air conditioning unit itself. This condenser could use some cleaning. Your outside unit is dirty.

<p>The outside of this unit usually features an outdoor coil that wraps around the condenser. This causes your air conditioner to struggle to cool your home. Your air filter is dirty. If youve checked for the problems above but your AC still isnt cooling down the house you probably have a larger problem that requires a professional. Usually leaks that happen over time are very slow but sometimes for reasons that I really dont understand but a heating and cooling guy could explain to you a hole develops in the condenser and coolant.
